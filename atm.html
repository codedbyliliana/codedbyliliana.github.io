    <h2>What is the ATM Program</h2>
    <p> ATM stands for applied technology magnet. In atm we use nothing but technology. It is a 3 year program in Bancroft Middle School. Also in atm you will be introduced to all different programs.</p>
  <h2>My experience at ATM</h2> 
  <p>ATM is helpful becuase the first thing I had learned was how to type and that helped me alot. For example in ELA once I had to type an essay by the end of the period I finsished because I had learned how to type. </p>
